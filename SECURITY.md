## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you ever found a vulnerability in the code, **DON'T** PR a fix 

To do so :

Vulnerabilities are only to be sent by GPG-encrypted emails with a subject containing `SECURITY` and a PoC script that would take advantage of the vulnerability

GPG key : `4283F127DD1E0E2EA976F3C0273140E170D76BA6` from https://keys.openpgp.org
And send the encrypted message

I will duely respond to the inquiry and shall discuss further actions in a 45-days period
